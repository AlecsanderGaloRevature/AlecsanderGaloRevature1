"Dads and Grads" Logic Puzzle

General Rules (GR): Three are dads, three are respective children; Michael, Ken, James, Alberto, Elias, Stephanie

Parameters, or P:
P#1: Stephanie went to the senior prom with Michael’s son.
P#2: Elias and James played on the school’s baseball team. One of them is Alberto’s son.
P#3: Michael and Elias are not related.

Solution:
Use P#1 to determine Stephanie is one of the kids. 
Use P#2 to determine that Elias and James are the two other kids.
The three graduates are therefore Stephanie, Elias, and James; the three parents must be Michael, Ken, and Alberto.
If Stephanie is not Michael’s child (P#1) and Elias is not Michael’s child (P#3), then James is Michael’s child.
Either James or Elias is Alberto’s child in P#2; since we established James is Michael’s child, Elias must be Alberto’s child.
This leaves Stephanie to be Ken’s child by elimination. 

Answer (father, child): (Michael, James) (Alberto, Elias) (Ken, Stephanie)
